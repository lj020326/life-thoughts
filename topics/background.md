# Notes on background

A little bit of personal life background and context is helpful.

I was born in 1970.  

I had an alcoholic mother and an absent father.

At the age of 2, my younger brother and I had been placed into a foster home for the next several years.
Then at 7, custody was given to our grandparents to raise us.

Then 3 short years later, the grandparents separated.

So at 10 years old, I was then raised by a single parent, my grandmother.

She was a college professor at a small private college who had no real assets to her name.
She had a very low pay and struggled to make ends meet month over month.

During the 1980's I went through my teen-years mostly with the hopes of getting into a good college.

My first paying job was as a paper-boy for the Asbury Park Press.

I found the tip money I made from this job to be a very positive experience.

I was able to buy a color TV for my bedroom and no longer had to watch the PBS shows my grandmother preferred to watch, as well as watching the Saturday morning cartoons/shows without disturbing her.

I was subsequently hired by one of my paper route customers to work for a glass art studio.

It was good work repairing stained-glass lamps, etching glass mirrors, and tables with power-blown led dust, and delivering to very nice homes/mansions in Deal and Manasquan as well as other nice beach enclaves along the Jersey shore.

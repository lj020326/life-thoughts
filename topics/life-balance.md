# Life balance and semi-retirement

In my twenties, just starting my work in the corporate space, I worked many long weeks usually putting in 60-70 hours / week.

In many cases, I worked during the weekends.

This continued into my 30's to 40' while raising my 2 daughters.

While at work, I always had responsibilities that went over and beyond the typical 40 hour week.

I did prioritize my personal time with family, wife, friends and consistently lacked dedication to equally or more important priorities in life other than my work.

As I am now in my 50's, well into the "the back-nine", I am now purposefully dedicated prioritizing time with family and friends, travel abroad, and experiences over income.

When there is the odd position that caters to my "semi-retired" state of mind and can benefit from my many years of technical experiences, I am only interested if those work priorities always are secondary and skew in favor of my semi-retired state of being.

I am now equally interested in other non-technical experiences, ranging from pickleball, tennis, bicycle riding, to learning pottery and other languages.

## Logging hours

If the job requires "punching a clock" and logging the hours of work as I have done many time in my life before, I am most certainly not interested.

If I had to place a duration / quantity to that, it would be the balance of time left over after family, friends, sleep and then the remainder, work.

The 8-hour day is even more commitment than I plan to spend at this point.

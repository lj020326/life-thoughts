# Life balance and semi-retirement

In my twenties, just starting my work in the corporate space, I worked many long weeks usually putting in 60-70 hours / week.

In many cases, I worked during the weekends.

This continued into my 30's to 40' while raising my 2 daughters.

While at work, I always had responsibilities that went over and beyond the typical 40 hour week.

I did prioritize my personal time with family, wife, friends and consistently lacked dedication to equally or more important priorities in life other than my work.

As I am now in my 50's, well into the "the back-nine", I am now purposefully dedicated prioritizing time with family and friends, travel abroad, and experiences over income.

When there is the odd position that caters to my "semi-retired" state of mind and can benefit from my many years of technical experiences, I am only interested if those work priorities always are secondary and skew in favor of my semi-retired state of being.

I am now equally interested in other non-technical experiences, ranging from pickleball, tennis, bicycle riding, to learning pottery and other languages.

## Pondering/Reflection on the software engineering field/career

I have had friends / acquaintances in many fields outside of technology.

Some of their professions/careers include doctors, lawyers, professors, musicians, artists, police, home builders, automobile mechanics, electricians, plumbers/HVAC specialists, real estate agents, teachers.  

In almost all cases, there is a general disciplinary path, with a premium on experience and the master-apprentice relationship.

For the lawyer, that may be evidenced by achieving a coveted "partner" level in a firm.

For a doctor, it may be evidenced by achieving consultations with insurers, participation on review boards, etc.

For a professor, it may be getting published and achieving authority status in the area of specialization.

A police sergent in larger towns can achieve a decent compensation level with a steady/consistent paycheck.

For the trades, include plumbers, electricians, etc, this can be evidenced by owning/running a company for the respective trade service. 

In some of the aforementioned fields, the benefits are derived from the sales and play a key factor to the degree of compensation.


### Constraint / dilemma of the software engineer/programmer

Musicians, actors/entertainers, professional athletes; they can derive the benefits for right of ownership for their intellectual property, representation, and work/efforts, and derive royalties.

That is not the case for most software engineers/programmers.

Software engineers that consistently make significant/key contributions to the respective technology stack very often have little to show/gain over time.

In most cases, the hiring firm retains all the rights over the product.

This leads to the situation where the sum-yield of all of the experience that a senior technical expert has does not ever get realized or rewarded/incentivized in any significant way.

This almost guarantees a culling in the field in that there simply is no tangible incentive to stay in the field over time.

To compound things, there are a slew of other field related challenges / factors:

- no premium for the experience level 
- no IP ownership for the products/services created
- no significant pay increases over time
- lack of steady income in field with high turnover 
- no long term path that is observed overall within the industry
- lack of generally accepted body of knowledge with corresponding professional certifications 
  - commonly recruited specializations include network engineer, database administrator, platform engineer, automation engineer, AI engineer, data scientist, etc)

# Notes on protests

In the 1970's, I grew up during the Vietnam-War and the peace-protest era.

It played a central/pivotal role in my understanding of large government, the war machine, and the effectiveness of mostly peaceful protests.

Then followed the protests throughout the 1980s including the (1) pro-life vs pro-abortion protests, (2) pro-Israel vs pro-Palestinian protests.

Perhaps naive and overly simplistic, my thoughts on protests were that as long as they were peaceful in nature, they could be effective at (1) getting attention from a wider audience, and (2) garnishing possible understanding, empathy and good will, and (3) moving the conversation forward and away from the atrocities of the past.

In my current age and circumstance of parenting I am now thinking through life and this dilemma as my kids are now asking for my thoughts on how to deal with the stress of the protests in their lives.

These notes are my attempt to outline how I think now as a parent and in mid-life about the stress of protests.

## Choosing a side?

Some protests are over atrocities committed throughout time by both sides.
Often they do not have the benefit of a simple truth of which side is on the moral high-ground.

There are cases where it seems protests over more simple/clearer topics that appear to have simple moral truth behind them.

Some examples:

  - pro-peace / anti-war
  - pro-abortion vs pro-life
  - Ethnic/Gender equality
  - pro-LGBTQ

Then there are those protests where it is over cultural/ethnic divides that have a long and drawn out history of atrocities.

Such examples:
  - The troubles (Northern Ireland vs UK)
  - Israel vs Palestine
  - ... too many more to list here

This list is almost infinite.

I have found in my life, it is one's best interest to steer clear of these since often they are long and drawn out divisions/quagmires that never fully resolve.

The atrocities of the past never change.  Memories always include the worst actions committed be each side.

At best, the idea _"to forgive but not forget"_ may be a temporary solvent/solution but never fully heals the wounds of the past.

## Who benefits from polarizing topics/beliefs

In many cases, where fundamental values/beliefs are concerned, either you are _for_ or _against_ the topic of concern and there is no middle ground.

These polarizing topics/beliefs are divisive and binary in nature and immediately divide the group into two.

Additionally, polarizing topics/beliefs can be used to divide groups that might otherwise agree on other progressive topics of concern/points of interest. 

Put another way, you can find a polarizing topic/issue to partition/subdivide any population.

An (bad) actor can advantage / benefit by exploiting polarizing topics/beliefs in order to push forward their own ulterior motives/agenda.

Think behind every set of divisions and the distractions that come with such divisions, there are individuals deriving ulterior benefit/advantage.

It is easy to fall victim to this type of exploitation.

Just ponder situations that occur where the person/actor has an ulterior motives/agendas and benefits from the division of a group using a binary/polarizing topic to push forward their own ulterior motive(s)/agenda(s).

The added benefit of such divisions, is once the divisions start, they rarely, if ever, come to a quick end.

## How to move forward? _common purpose_?

How does one live in a state where there is perpetual protests/disagreements, and the atrocities of the past.

It helps to have an idea of what is the ideal/zen state to live in given the (1) multitude of differences between any two people in a population and (2) facts of the past.

If we assemble a diverse group where there are many perceptions of reality based on their personal and cultural/ethnic experiences, there are infinite possible ideas of what is considered a healthy way to move forward.

So in a modern democratic/republic/parliamentary society, what does a picture of a healthy but diverse population look like?

To start with, a priority would be to place an emphasis on the most common foundation for a society, that is "humanity" and common "moral decency".

Consider the historical example were there has been a cause for the population to become unified in _common purpose_ with World War II.
The population moved away from binary/dividing topics to answer a larger more pressing common concern for existence.

Similarly, a healthy diverse modern society with _common purpose_ would look to de-emphasize topics/variables that work to divide/partition the group based on cultural/ethnic/religious backgrounds/beliefs.  A group with _common purpose_ would look to mitigate (de-emphasize/de-program/dis-incentivize) the behavior of actors that would seek to place an emphasis on the differences between individuals based solely on cultural/ethnic/relgious background and/or past atrocities.

This is not to suggest that the diverseness of the population should be diminished, but instead, should look to stress the benefits of having a multitude of different ideas on how to solve societal issues, but yet remain true to a "common value system" with a societally accepted set of core values and beliefs for decency and moral truths.

A possible set of concerns for having a _common purpose society_ is that it can lay the foundation for a nationalistic/centralist/communist government framework that can have even worse implications (E.g., Orwelian _thoughtcrimes_ with necessary _thought police_).  

## Stress from changing/evolving societal _common moral values_

Historically, the USA was a set of colonies initiated by a set of puritans abiding by a set of Christian/Biblical based values.

The societal values have steadily changed/evolved over time to an ever-progressing/evolving state of societal values.

The challenge in the transition from classic Christian value system to an ever-changing amorphous / secular set of values is that there is no longer a static, universal moral code or set of truths.

A stress point for a diverse democratic population, is how does it conform with a changing moral code over time especially given that at any point in time there are numerous cultural/ethnic/religious differences based on the past now combined with an ever-changing secular-based societal moral code.

## No real zen solution

The simple fact is that there can never be a universally accepted set of societal moral truths.

So there will always be a wax-and-wane aspect to a democratic vote-driven society.

This means if the fact that society can change its perception of moral acceptance over time based on votes, that one has to constantly/consistently adapt with an ever evolving/changing moral landscape put forth by a secular vote driven society.

There will be many differences in how one can live according to a static/rigid set of cultural/religious values and yet be expected to reconcile life with the societally accepted norms.
